      <h1>Nikah Plus – Marriage Matching App</h1>
      <p>Nikah Plus is a modern and user-friendly mobile application designed to help individuals find suitable marriage partners based on compatibility, preferences, and values. The app offers features like profile creation, interest selection, secure authentication, and match discovery through a clean and intuitive UI.</p>
      <p>I worked on building the UI using Flutter, implemented secure user registration and login with Firebase Authentication, and handled real-time data using Cloud Firestore. Special focus was given to smooth user experience, privacy, and mobile responsiveness.</p>
